      "Content: Title: Superb Pasta!; Content: *****<br /><br />Oh, I love this pasta! It is thick, chewy, absolutely extraordinary! And made with authentic flavorings to boot! The red are flavored with tomato and red beet powder. The green are flavored with spinach powder and basil powder. The black pastas are flavored with squid ink, the off-white are au naturale. The yellow pasta are flavored with turmeric, the orange with carrot powder. A rainbow of beauty and natural delectable flavor.<br /><br />The pasta are shaped like little cresent moons with a rough exterior to absorb whatever sauce or oil you might use. Because this pasta is so very flavorful, I enjoy it best with a good quality olive oil and some Celtic sea salt. Sometimes I add some tarragon or fresh rosemary, usually not, so I can just savor the pasta alone. It also is excellent with olive oil and fresh grated Parmesan chees on top.<br /><br />With only 1g of fat, 10g of sodium, this can also be a heart-healthy meal. There are 7g of protein and 42g of carbos, no added sugars or preservatives.<br /><br />It is the perfect easy dish to impress company or a date!<br /><br />To be able to buy the best packaged pasta in the whole wide world at HALF PRICE in bulk from Amazon is a wonderful privilege. You will not be disappointed.<br /><br />*****\n",

And the best chocolate in the United States is made in California, by the Ghirardelli Chocolate Company. It is surely the best chocolate that one can find in so many stores, malls, etc. throughout the United States. Their actual stores are rare, but Kroger, Wal-Mart, Martin's (formerly Ukrops) and a long list of other grocery stores and many malls stock their products.<br /><br />I have never encountered milk chocolates with caramel filling to surpass the quality of these. These are chocolates deserving of poetry. You can eat them quickly, or take your time and savor every moment of eating every one. The choice is up to you.\n",

      "Content: Title: I agree with the previous reviewer, the name is deceptive.; Content: When one purchases a product that is called Newman's Organics, one would expect organic food.  Not just the vegetables, which are much less expensive to be organic than the meat or chicken.  I was very, very disappointed to find out that the chicken is not organic.  For a couple of dollars more, just buy real organic dog food. This dog food isn't exactly cheap, so you expect that they will provide what they are advertising.  This whole \"greenwashing\" thing needs to be regulated better.  If someone uses the word organic in their description, it better be organic.  Otherwise the consumer is being deceived which is unfortunate.  Newmans has a great reputation, I buy a lot of their products, but this was intentionally deceptive and it makes me reconsider buying anything from them in the future.<br /><br />On the positive side, my dog loved it, she would lick the bowl around the room for 20 minutes after the last morsel was consumed.  I have no idea what they put in it that tasted so good, it's like the crack cocaine of dog food.  She has never been a finicky eater, she'll pretty much eat anything voraciously, but this stuff really rocked her epicurean world.  Too bad she isn't getting any more of it.\n",

      "Content: Title: NOT DOP Certified! But Organic!; Content: I received my order with a few problems. The majority of the cans arrived dented, some very severely! Amazon needs to add better packing material to keep the cans from moving around in the shipping box, I am surprised they haven't fixed this shipping issue by now because of all the complaints here in the reviews. However, Amazon is really great when it comes to problems like this with food items...they are shipping me a new order, no charge, and I get to keep my original order! I am hoping my new order arrives in better condition! These San Marzano Tomatoes are not \"DOP Certified\"! Even though the description says they are? Many people have complained about this in the reviews so I am surprised Amazon is still listing them as \"DOP Certified\"? However, they are very good quality tomatoes and Certified Organic. I have also noticed the price of this item fluctuates often so here's a tip...place it in your shopping cart and then save it for later, check your cart daily and wait for the price to drop! I paid $20.79 but I have seen the price as high as $53.00, so it pays to be patient. Good luck!\n",
